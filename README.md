# calculator-with-functions

## What The Program Does?
Demonstrates a calculator's basic features for two numbers, but using functions rather than\
the math operations being done in a script without functions.

## Background
This is part of the continuation of the calculator program we designed in java1 that became\
increasingly more complex as the course went on. We would make slight changes throughout\
the semester.
